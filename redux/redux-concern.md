# Redux Concerns
Redux requires too much boilerplate code.
- Action
- Action object
- Action creator
- Switch statement in a reducer

A lot of other packages have to be installed to work with redux
- Redux-thunk
- immer
- Redux-devtools

There was a need to improve the developer experience for redux. And that is what resulted in the creation of `Redux Toolkit` library.
